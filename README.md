# PROJECT Apollo â€“ Text and Network Analysis in Astronomy and Astrophysics

Supervised by Charles J. Gomez, this repository showcases the innovative PROJECT Apollo, aiming to uncover historical trends and collaborative networks within Astronomy and Astrophysics through advanced data analytics.

## Project Description
PROJECT Apollo is a groundbreaking endeavor that applies Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis to a vast dataset of research works. The project's core objective is to reveal historical patterns, international collaborations, and information exchange through dynamic topic modeling and citation network analysis. With a dataset encompassing over 500,000 research abstracts dating back to 1824, the project employs the Structural Topic Modeling algorithm, extends to manual labeling and classification with weak supervision, and culminates in intricate Network Analysis to map out the scholarly landscape.

### Objectives
- Identify and analyze the contributions of different countries to the field over time.
- Decode the usage of astronomical tools such as telescopes and satellites in research.
- Understand the dynamics of information flow through citation and coauthorship networks.

## Data Source
The comprehensive dataset includes:
- Over 500,000 abstracts from OpenAlex, enriched with metadata for robust analysis.
- Citation, Coauthorship, and Satellite Data Sharing Networks to map out scholarly interactions.

## Methodology
- **Topic Modeling:** Utilizing algorithms like STM, DTM, and DIM for thematic analysis.
- **Text Classification:** Implementing the Snorkel framework for data categorization.
- **Network Analysis:** Employing 'Networkx' and other Python and R libraries to visualize connections.

## NOTE - The latest files for this research is predominantly stored, shared and managed between the two authors in other platforms (HPC repositories and box folders), the files on gitHub are only to showcase the projects to others. The data files and the SQL queries to retrieve and format the data from OpenAlex database is removed from this repository (to protect our data integrity) and is stored in our personal HPC server repository, and our personal box folder.

### New Direction:
We're emphasizing the changing dynamics of countries and not focus as much on the dynamics and content of the field (of astrophysics/astronomy). In other words, our primary focus won't be which topics dominate the field and what those topics are, what telescopes were used, etc. Our plan is to eventually do this analysis for hundreds of fields, meaning we'll need to create a pipeline in R and Python (not leveraging RStudio or Jupyter Notebook) on the HPCs, the codes have been written keeping this in mind for an easy integration with the pipeline.

As far as studying how the dominance/influence of a country changes when the field changes is concerned, fields don't tend to radically change. They're fairly conservative. Our focus is on countries, but looking at their dynamics across fields. So, fields are in the background in terms of our analyses.

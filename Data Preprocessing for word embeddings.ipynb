       "array(['KINEMATIC TREATMENT OF CORONAL MASS EJECTION EVOLUTION IN THE SOLAR WIND We present a kinematic study of the evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the solar wind. Specifically, we consider the effects of (1) spherical expansion and (2) uniform expansion due to pressure gradients between the interplanetary CME (ICME) and the ambient solar wind. We compare these results with an MHD model that allows us to isolate these effects from the combined kinematic and dynamical effects, which are included in MHD models. They also provide compelling evidence that the fundamental cross section of so-called \"force-free\" flux ropes (or magnetic clouds) is neither circular or elliptical, but rather a convex-outward, \"pancake\" shape. We apply a force-free fit to the magnetic vectors from the MHD simulation to assess how the distortion of the flux rope affects the fit. In spite of these limitations, force-free fits, which are straightforward to apply, do provide an important description of a number of parameters, including the radial dimension, orientation, and chirality of the ICME.',\n",
       "       'The imaging performance of the Hubble Space Telescope Problems with the HST instantaneous imaging performance and pointing performance are discussed. Optical tests have clearly demonstrated that the HST suffers from spherical aberration. The top level specification was that 70 percent of the energy be focused in a 0.1 in. radius, but the present, and close to optimum, focus setting gives only about 16 percent. The pointing control system also is having problems with the results that the spacecraft achieves a stability of about 0.007 rms in quiescent periods, falling short of specification which requires that such performance be maintained for 24 hr. The finite guidance sensors are not guiding well on faint stars. There is a loss of sky coverage at high Galactic latitude, especially for the Wide-Field/Planetary Camera. The consequences of these defects for the scientific program are examined.',\n",
       "       'Numerical Simulations of Mass Outflows Driven from Accretion Disks by Radiation and Magnetic Forces We study the two-dimensional, time-dependent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of radiation-driven winds from luminous accretion disks initially threaded by a purely axial magnetic field. The radiation force is mediated primarily by spectral lines and is calculated using a generalized multidimensional formulation of the Sobolev approximation. We use ideal MHD to compute numerically the evolution of Keplerian disks, varying the magnetic field strengths and the luminosity of the disk, the central accreting object, or both. We find that the magnetic fields very quickly start deviating from purely axial because of the magnetorotational instability. This leads to fast growth of the toroidal magnetic field as field lines wind up because of the disk rotation. As a result the toroidal field dominates over the poloidal field above the disk and the gradient of the former drives a slow and dense disk outflow, which conserves specific angular momentum. Depending on the strength of the magnetic field relative to the system luminosity, the disk wind can be radiation or MHD driven. The pure radiation-driven wind consists of a dense, slow outflow that is bounded on the polar side by a high-velocity stream. The mass-loss rate is mostly due to the fast stream. As the magnetic field strength increases, first the slow part of the flow is affected; namely, it becomes denser and slightly faster and begins to dominate the mass-loss rate. In very strong magnetic field or pure MHD cases, the wind consists of only a dense, slow outflow without the presence of the distinctive fast stream so typical of pure radiation-driven winds. Our simulations indicate that winds launched by the magnetic fields are likely to remain dominated by the fields downstream because of their relatively high densities. The radiation force due to lines may not be able to change a dense MHD wind because the line force strongly decreases with increasing density.

       "       'Observations of the Solar Corona from Space Space observations of the atmosphere of the Sun, obtained in half a century of dedicated space missions, provide a well established picture of the medium and large-scale solar corona, which is highly variable with the level of solar activity through a solar cycle and evolves with the long-term evolution of the magnetic cycles. In this review, we summarize the physical properties and dynamics of the medium and large-scale corona, consisting primarily of active regions, streamers and coronal holes; describe the dependence of coronal patterns on the magnetic field patterns changing through the solar cycle and the properties of the regions of open magnetic flux channeling the solar wind; the ubiquitous presence of fluctuations in the outer corona; the rotational properties of the large-scale corona; and the persistent hemispheric asymmetries in the emergence of magnetic fields and the distribution of the coronal emission.',\n",
       "       'Constraints on the topology of the Universe derived from the 7-yr WMAP data We impose constraints on the topology of the Universe determined from a search for matched circles in the temperature anisotropy patterns of the 7-yr Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data. We pay special attention to the sensitivity of the method to residual foreground contamination of the sky maps and show that for a full-sky estimate of the CMB signal (the Internal Linear Combination map) such residuals introduce a non-negligible effect on the statistics of matched circles. In order to reduce this effect, we perform the analysis on maps for which the most contaminated regions have been removed. A search for pairs of matched back-to-back circles in the higher resolution WMAP W-band map allows tighter constraints to be imposed on topology. Our results rule out universes with topologies that predict pairs of such circles with radii larger than α min ≈ 10°. This places a lower bound on the size of the fundamental domain for a flat universe of about 27.9 Gpc. This bound is close to the upper limit on the size of Universe possible to be detected by the method of matched circles, i.e. the diameter of the observable Universe is 28.3 Gpc.',\n",
       "       'Formation of Kuiper-belt binaries through multiple chaotic scattering encounters with low-mass intruders The discovery that many trans-Neptunian objects exist in pairs, or binaries, is proving invaluable for shedding light on the formation, evolution and structure of the outer Solar system. Based on recent systematic searches it has been estimated that up to 10 per cent of Kuiper-belt objects might be binaries. However, all examples discovered to date are unusual, as compared with near-Earth and main-belt asteroid binaries, for their mass ratios of the order of unity and their large, eccentric orbits. In this article we propose a common dynamical origin for these compositional and orbital properties based on four-body simulations in the Hill approximation. Our calculations suggest that binaries are produced through the following chain of events. Initially, long-lived quasi-bound binaries form by two bodies getting entangled in thin layers of dynamical chaos produced by solar tides within the Hill sphere. Next, energy transfer through gravitational scattering with a low-mass intruder nudges the binary into a nearby non-chaotic, stable zone of phase space. Finally, the binary hardens (loses energy) through a series of relatively gentle gravitational scattering encounters with further intruders. This produces binary orbits that are well fitted by Kepler ellipses. Dynamically, the overall process is strongly favoured if the original quasi-bound binary contains comparable masses. We propose a simplified model of chaotic scattering to explain these results. Our findings suggest that the observed preference for roughly equal-mass ratio binaries is probably a real effect; that is, it is not primarily due to an observational bias for widely separated, comparably bright objects. Nevertheless, we predict that a sizeable population of very unequal-mass Kuiper-belt binaries is probably awaiting discovery.'],\n",
